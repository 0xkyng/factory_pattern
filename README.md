The purpose of the `FactoryContract` contract is to act as a factory for creating instances of another contract called `StudentDetails`. This design pattern is commonly referred to as a Factory Pattern in smart contract development.The purpose of the `FactoryContract` contract is to act as a factory for creating instances of another contract called `StudentDetails`. This design pattern is commonly referred to as a Factory Pattern in smart contract development.

Here's the breakdown of the purpose and usage of this contract:

1. Factory Pattern: The `FactoryContract` contract is designed to create multiple instances of the `StudentDetails` contract. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to create multiple instances of a similar contract, each representing different students or entities. Instead of deploying each `StudentDetails` contract individually, you can use this factory to streamline the creation process.

2. Separation of Concerns: By separating the logic for creating new `StudentDetails` contracts into a factory contract, you keep the creation process separate from the functionality of the `StudentDetails` contract. This separation can make your code more modular and maintainable.

3. Record Keeping: The factory contract maintains an array (Details) to keep track of all the `StudentDetails` contracts it has created. This array allows you to easily reference and manage the instances you've created.

In summary, the purpose of this contract is to simplify the process of creating and keeping track of individual student details contracts. It provides a structured way to deploy and manage these contracts, making it easier to work with a collection of student-related data on the Ethereum blockchain.
